"""
Downloading and installing Julia is quite simple. A detailed information:

## Downloading and Installing Julia:

1. **Visit Official Julia Website:**

    As a first step, visit the official Julia website:
        https://julialang.org/

2. **Find the Download Page:**

    On the home page there is something like "Download" or "Downloads"
        There must be a link. Download Julia by clicking this link
        Go to page.

        Click.

4. **Start Download:**

    The download will begin. The downloaded file is usually a
        is the installation file.

5. **Run the Setup File:**

    Run the downloaded installation file by double-clicking it.

6. **Setup Wizard:**

    The installation wizard will start. Such as language selection and license agreement
        follow the steps.

7. **Loading Location:**

    Select the directory where you want to install Julia. Usually recommended default
        The installation path can be selected.

8. **Completing the Installation:**

        Click the button.

9. **Completing the Installation:**

    When the installation is completed, install it by clicking the "Finish" button.

10. **Launch Julia REPL:**

     After the installation is completed successfully, to use Julia
         You can start Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). REPL,
         It allows you to write and run Julia code.

11. **Use Julia REPL:**

     Julia REPL can be used to write and run Julia codes. codes
         You can run it by typing and pressing Enter and get the results instantly.
         you can see.

# --->>> Using Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

"""
  Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is the application of the Julia language in an interactive environment.
      It is a command line interface that allows you to use REPL, write codes and
      run, see immediate results, and view language features
      allows you to explore. Below is detailed information about using Julia REPL.
      An information is given:

## Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) Usage:

1. **Julia REPL Initialization:**

    After installing Julia on your computer to start Julia REPL
        Open terminal (command prompt) and enter the command "julia". Like this
        Julia REPL will start automatically.

2. **Writing and Executing Commands:**

    You can run codes in Julia REPL by typing them and pressing the Enter key.
        For example, to perform a simple mathematical operation, you can type something like this:
        You can enter a command and press Enter:
           
--->>> julia> 2 + 3

    As a result, REPL will write the result of the operation to the screen:

--->>> 5


3. **Definition of Variables:**

    Variables are used to store values. Variables in Julia REPL
        you can define and assign value:

--->>> julia> x = 10

    This assigns the value "10" to the variable "x".

4. **Displaying Variable Values:**

    To see the values of the variables you define, just type the name of the variable.
        Just type:

--->>> julia> x

--->>> 10

5. **Defining and Calling Functions:**

    You can define and call your own functions in Julia REPL:
       

--->>> julia> function square(x)
                   return x * x
               end

    Now let's call the "square" function we created:

--->>> julia> square(5)

--->>> 25

6. **Code Completion (Tab Hint):**

    Julia REPL offers code completion. While typing a command, press the Tab key.
        Recommendations about available functions, variables and modules by pressing
        You can take. This will help you quickly complete the code you wrote.
        It helps.

7. **View Documentation:**

    Documentation for built-in functions and modules in Julia
        you can access. Add a question mark at the end of your function or module name.
        You can view the documentation by adding:

--->>> julia> ?sqrt

    This will open documentation about the "sqrt" function.

8. **Exit and Close REPL:**

    `Ctrl + D` (for Linux and macOS) or `Ctrl + Z` to exit Julia REPL
        You can press (for Windows).

Julia REPL to quickly try, learn and explore the Julia language
     It is a great tool. As you progress, you can write more complex code, package
     You can install it and discover the strengths of the language.
